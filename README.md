# Gravitational Lensing Simulator

## Description
This Flask-based web application visualizes the trajectory of light near massive objects, demonstrating the principles of gravitational lensing and spacetime curvature in accordance with Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It's an interactive tool designed for educational purposes, allowing users to input different masses and see how they would influence the path of light in space.

## Features
- Interactive input to set the mass of celestial bodies.
- Visualization of light bending due to gravitational forces.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Installation

To set up the gravitational lensing simulator on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
